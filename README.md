##Chess Game

A chess game developed by Vlad and David

At the moment:
- all of the pieces move accordingly to the chess rules
- pieces remove themselves

We need to implement:

- a  buffer with all of the removed chess pieces so that they can be called back when a pawn reaches the end of the board
- the rule for the end of the game (check/checkmate)
